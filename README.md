# Group Project Proposal:
Idea: Minecraft

The focus is on the player, their inventory, and a crafting system. This is kinda like a crafting menu. The player should be able to collect, view/manage inventory, and craft new items. Relational DB: Recipes, inventory, items, and players are all relational. Read/Write: Players collect items (write), view inventory (read), and craft (read + write).

# Getting Started:

installation CLI command: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

to run the server: ``` uvicorn app.main:app --reload ```

list of items:
